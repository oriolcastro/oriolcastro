### Hi there!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

My name is Oriol Casto Arnau, but you can call me Oriol or just Uri for short. I'm a front-end developer living in a beautiful Mediterranean small city called Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ near Barcelona and fully connected to the world.

I have been always interested in everything related to technology and how it can change the way we live. In 2017 I decided to make a turn in my career and become a full-time professional developer.

In 2017 I decided to make a turn in my career and become a full-time professional developer. Since then I have worked first as a part-time freelancer while I level up my skills, and now I'm a front-end engineer at [Xceed](https://xceed.me/). I consider myself a product-centric engineer, I thrive when outlining, architecting, and developing enjoyable and crafted products that scale.

Always willing to learn new things.

Make it easy, do it right, and achieve it together!
