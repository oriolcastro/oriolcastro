### Hi there!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

My name is Oriol Casto Arnau, but you can call me Oriol or just Uri for short. I'm a product engineer currently focused on the frontend web platform and living in a beautiful Mediterranean small city called Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ near Barcelona.

I have been always interested in everything related to technology and how it can change the way we live. In 2017 I decided to make a turn in my career and become a full-time professional developer.

Since then I have worked first as a part-time freelancer while leveling up my skills, then at [Xceed](https://xceed.me/), [Immfly](https://immfly.com/), and [Gigapipe](https://www.gigapipe.com). I consider myself a product-centric engineer, I thrive when outlining, architecting, and developing enjoyable and crafted products that scale. What it means to be a Product Engineer to me? [This article from Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/blog/product-engineers#what-are-product-engineers) summarizes it very well.

Always willing to learn new things.

Make it easy, do it right, and achieve it together!
