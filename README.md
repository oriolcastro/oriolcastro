### Hi there!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

My name is Oriol Casto Arnau, but you can call me Oriol or just Uri for short. I'm a front-end developer living in a beautiful Mediterranean small city called Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ near Barcelona and fully connected to the world.

I have been always interested in everything related to technology and how it can change the way we live. In 2017 I decided to make a turn in my career and become a full-time professional developer.

Since then I have worked first as a part-time freelancer while I level up my skills, and now I'm a front-end engineer at [Xceed](https://xceed.me/). I consider myself a product-centric programmer because I love to outline, architect, and develop enjoyable and crafted products that scale.

Always willing to learn new things.

You can find me in social media as @oriolcastro_ or read more at [my blog](https://www.oriolcastro.me/)
