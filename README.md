### Hi there!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

My name is Oriol Casto Arnau, but you can call me Oriol or just Uri for short. I'm a product engineer currently focused on the web platform and living in a beautiful Mediterranean small city called Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ near Barcelona.

I have always been passionate about technology and its potential to change the way we live. In 2017, I made a decisive career pivot, fully committing to becoming a professional software developer.

Since then, I have worked first as freelancer while leveling up my skills, then at [Xceed](https://xceed.me/), [Immfly](https://immfly.com/), [Gigapipe](https://www.gigapipe.com) and [toddl.co](https://todld.co). I consider myself a product-centric engineer, I thrive when outlining, architecting, and developing enjoyable and crafted products that scale. 

What it means to be a Product Engineer to me? Being someone that pursue solving users problems by building products from inception to shipping. [This article from Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/blog/product-engineers#what-are-product-engineers) and [this other from PostHog](https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer) expand that concept very well.

My motto has always been: Make it easier, do it right, and achieve it together!
